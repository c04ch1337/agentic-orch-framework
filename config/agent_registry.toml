# PHOENIX ORCH: Agent Registry Configuration - Core/Universal Agents Only
# This file defines the agents available for task delegation.
# By default, the registry starts empty. Operators may add core agents here
# (e.g., tools service, executor) as needed. No specialty/red-team/blue-team
# agents are defined by default.
#
# The agent-registry-rs service loads this file at startup.
#
# Example (commented out by default):
#
# [[agent]]
# name = "TOOLS_SERVICE"
# port = 50070
# role = "Core tools execution service"
# capabilities = [
#     "http_request",
#     "shell_command",
# ]
